## 🧠 **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) Full Preparation Roadmap**

### **1. OOP Basics**

- What is OOP?
- Why OOP? Advantages over procedural programming
- Real-life examples of OOP
- Features of OOP
- Object, Class, Instance
- Syntax of class and object creation

---

### **2. Class and Object (Core Foundation)**

- Class definition and declaration
- Creating objects
- Accessing data members and methods
- `this` keyword (and its use cases)
- Memory allocation for objects (stack vs heap)

---

### **3. Encapsulation**

- Definition and importance
- Access Modifiers → `public`, `private`, `protected`
- Getters and Setters (use + examples)
- Data Hiding concept
- Why encapsulation improves security

---

### **4. Abstraction**

- Definition and purpose
- Difference between abstraction and encapsulation
- Abstract class
- Pure virtual function (in C++)
- Interface (in Java/Python)
- Real-life examples (e.g., car, remote control)

---

### **5. Inheritance**

- Concept and Need
- Types of Inheritance:

  - Single
  - Multiple
  - Multilevel
  - Hierarchical
  - Hybrid

- Constructor and Destructor behavior in inheritance
- `super` / `base` / `derived` class usage
- Method Overriding
- “Is-A” relationship concept
- Problems in multiple inheritance (like ambiguity in C++)
- Virtual inheritance

---

### **6. Polymorphism**

- Definition (many forms)
- Types:

  - **Compile-time (Static)** → Function Overloading, Operator Overloading
  - **Runtime (Dynamic)** → Method Overriding, Virtual Functions

- Virtual functions and vtable mechanism
- Pure virtual functions
- `final` keyword (in Java) / `override` keyword (C++)
- Upcasting and Downcasting
- Real-world example of polymorphism

---

### **7. Constructors and Destructors**

- Default Constructor
- Parameterized Constructor
- Copy Constructor
- Constructor Overloading
- Destructor and its importance
- Order of constructor/destructor calls in inheritance
- Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy

---

### **8. Static Members**

- Static variables in class
- Static methods
- Static block (in Java)
- Difference between static and non-static
- When to use static

---

### **9. Operator Overloading (C++ specific but conceptually important)**

- What is operator overloading
- Which operators can/cannot be overloaded
- Syntax of operator overloading
- Friend function usage in operator overloading

---

### **10. Friend Function and Friend Class (C++ specific)**

- What is friend function
- Why use it
- Accessing private members using friend
- Difference between friend and normal function

---

### **11. ‘this’ Pointer**

- Meaning and working
- When to use it
- Returning object reference using `this`

---

### **12. Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes**

- What is a virtual function
- Late binding concept
- Pure virtual function
- Abstract class vs interface
- Difference between virtual and pure virtual

---

### **13. Interface (Java / Python specific)**

- What is an interface
- Why use it
- Difference between abstract class and interface
- Multiple interface implementation

---

### **14. Dynamic Binding & Static Binding**

- Compile-time binding vs Run-time binding
- How function calls are resolved in both cases

---

### **15. Object Slicing (Advanced, esp. in C++)**

- What it is and when it happens
- How to prevent it

---

### **16. Composition vs Inheritance (HAS-A vs IS-A)**

- Difference between Composition and Inheritance
- When to prefer composition over inheritance

---

### **17. Aggregation and Association**

- Association types (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many)
- Aggregation vs Composition difference
- Real-world examples

---

### **18. Overloading vs Overriding (Must-Asked)**

- Difference with examples
- Rules for each
- Can constructor be overloaded/overridden?

---

### **19. Access Specifiers (Detailed)**

- Private
- Public
- Protected
- Default (package-private in Java)
- Scope and visibility rules

---

### **20. Object Lifecycle & Garbage Collection**

- Object creation and destruction
- Garbage collector (Java/Python)
- `finalize()` method in Java
- Smart pointers in C++

---

### **21. Design Principles & Patterns (For Advanced Interviews)**

- SOLID Principles:

  - **S**ingle Responsibility
  - **O**pen/Closed
  - **L**iskov Substitution
  - **I**nterface Segregation
  - **D**ependency Inversion

- DRY, KISS, YAGNI
- Basic Design Patterns:

  - Singleton
  - Factory
  - Builder
  - Prototype
  - Adapter
  - Observer
  - Strategy

---
